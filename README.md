# Python-Arcade
This is a Arcade created using Python and the Pygame module.
So far there are only a few basics:
* Pong
* Breakout
* Snake
* Space Invaders (In progress)

##How to play
1. Download [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml), if not installed!
2. Clone the repository
3. Each game can be accessed in their directory
4. python game.py

#Note:
I created this to teach myself python and to experiment with game programming.
These games are not great, but they were fun to create and I made them for my
own enjoyment and experience.
